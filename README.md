# Pythagorean-Triplet-Generator

Given a non negative integer A, print all the pairs of integers(a,b) such that a and b are positive integers 
a&lt;=b and a^2 + b^2 = A 0 &lt;= A A&lt;=1000  Problem statement is pretty clear,
We just need to find such pairs who satisfies the Pythagoras theorem up-to that number. 
The idea is to put two nested loops and print those numbers whose squared sum is equal to the given number.
